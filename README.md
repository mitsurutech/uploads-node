# File uploads: S3 for the bytes, Postgres for everything else

A sample app for the [MitsuruTech Learning Platform](https://mitsurutech.co.uk). Upload a
file; S3 keeps it; Postgres remembers where it went and what it is called. The table on the
page comes out of Postgres, and every download comes out of S3.

It is deliberately small — four routes and three files — so you can read the whole thing
before you change any of it.

```
server.js   the web: four routes and nothing else
store.js    the two stores, and the order they are written in
page.js     the HTML
```

## Deploying it here

Open **Deploy** on the platform, pick this repository, and start a **database** and the
**cloud stack** alongside it. Everything the app needs is then in its environment already;
there is nothing to configure.

| Variable | Set by | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | your session | the Postgres server running as `db` |
| `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` | your session | the cloud stack running as `cloud` |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` | your session | credentials for it |
| `PORT` | the platform | the port to listen on |
| `BUCKET_NAME` | you, optionally | defaults to `uploads` |

## The three things worth reading

**1. `forcePathStyle: true`, in `store.js`.** This is the setting everybody misses first. By
default the AWS SDK puts the bucket in the hostname — `uploads.cloud` — and there is no such
name on your session's network, so every call fails with a DNS error that says nothing about
buckets. Path style asks for `http://cloud:4566/uploads/...` instead.

**2. The app makes its own bucket.** Your cloud stack starts completely empty, exactly as a
real AWS account you just opened would. `CreateBucket` is your code's job, it runs on every
start, and it catches "you already own this" so a restart is not a crash.

**3. Write S3 first, then the row. Delete the row first, then S3.**

- Upload the bytes, then insert the row. If the insert fails you have an object nobody
  points at: invisible, harmless, sweepable.
- Write the row first and a failed upload leaves a file on the page that cannot be opened,
  and no way to tell that row from a good one.
- Deleting runs the other way for the same reason.

One of those failures is a few wasted bytes. The other is a broken page. Always let the
thing that can be orphaned harmlessly go first.

## Two safety habits, taken seriously in a sample on purpose

**The S3 key is a uuid, never the filename.** Two people upload `notes.txt` and one must not
overwrite the other; and a name that came from a browser is not a thing to build a path from
— `../../etc/passwd` is a perfectly valid filename as far as a form is concerned. The real
name is a column, which is where it is safe.

**Downloads are always `attachment`, always `application/octet-stream`, always `nosniff`.**
Anybody can upload anything. An HTML file served inline would run as a page on your app's own
address, with whatever that page can reach; saved to disk it is inert.

And every filename is escaped on the way back onto the page: a file called
`<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` is a perfectly good filename and must not become markup.

## Running it on your own machine

You need a Postgres and something S3-shaped. With Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev --name pg postgres:16
docker run -d -p 4566:4566 --name cloud localstack/localstack

export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:dev@localhost:5432/postgres
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL=http://localhost:4566
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test AWS_REGION=us-east-1

npm ci
npm start
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>.

## Things to try next

- Stream a large upload straight to S3 instead of holding it in memory (`store.js` says
  where).
- Add a download count, in DynamoDB — your cloud stack emulates that too.
- Put the files behind a login, so the table is per person.
- Show an image preview, using a pre-signed URL rather than proxying the bytes.
